At the beginning of 2020, I wrote <a href=\"https://soniasingla.com/review-2019-goals-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">my goals for this year</a>, out of which getting healthier, taking care of my own self is one of the goal I want to achieve. For the major part of my day, I keep sitting on my chair, and even skip meals just because i don’t want to get out of it. I am happy to share that I am working on this and hopefully, this will go a long way 🏃🏻‍♀️</p>\n<p>I had the weekly sync up meeting with my mentors, <a href=\"https://www.bwplotka.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bartek Plotka</a> and <a href=\"https://povilasv.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Povilas Versockas</a>, where we discussed about the raw documentation I prepared on <i><strong>“Downsampling and unlimited metric retention”</strong></i> which was really vague. I spent most of my second week in reading Thanos documentation, blog posts, finding all possible user cases that are necessary for the tutorial. Get to know more about <strong><a href=\"https://thanos.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Thanos</a></strong>, a set of components to make our Prometheus deployments a long-term TSDB solution with Highly Available setup. <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Thanos</a> has greatly enriched the metrics system, providing users with a single centralized query pane and a long term data storage, whilst making our Prometheus stack scalable and highly available! I am updating everything in GitHub as draft, you can view the pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2757\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Delivered 5 min short talk in our Mentees Hangout Meet, last Friday 😻💙. Apart from that, I got my first pull request merged 😍 (although, it was a small fix 😛).</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/3ade3799de1f289ac98ad0b547c7748e/party.gif\">\n</p>\n<center><sub>Yeyyyyyyee&#x1F389;</sub></center><br>\n<p>I managed to send 3 pull requests this week, out of which I need to update the two pull requests 👩🏻‍💻.
