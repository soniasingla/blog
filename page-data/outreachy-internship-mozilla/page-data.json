As part of this Outreachy round, I will be working on prototyping the next version of in-browser reporting component. The reporter is implemented as a standalone WebExtension, that leverages both standard WebExtension APIs as well as some Firefox-specific APIs that allows gathering more information, like taking a screenshot and collecting error messages from the JavaScript error console.</p>\n<p>This task includes adopting the existing UX/UI concepts for the new web reporting form to fit the in-browser reporter, coming up with solutions for interactions exclusive to the reporter component, and implementing these ideas as a WebExtension to be possibly embedded into Firefox 🦊.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-outreachy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-is-outreachy\" aria-label=\"what is outreachy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is Outreachy?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Outreachy</a> provides three-month internships to work in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

Then, you will receive a confirmation email within a week or two if you can keep up the application process.</p>\n<p>Once an initial application is approved, you have to pick the projects you want to work on. Many projects sound interesting 🤔 and we may want to join them all, but we will not have enough time. Give yourself some criteria for choosing projects, then pick 1–2 most potential projects and start making contributions to them. Sounds interesting 😉?</p>\n<p><strong>Dennis says: If you have any questions, make yourself heard, and keep in mind there are no stupid questions 🙂</strong></p>\n<p>You need to set your own deadlines, make progress towards the projects and create a final application.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/b7cb9f375b765b17e227222fa81d014c/excited.gif\">\n</p>\n<center><sub>Sonia&#x2019;s reaction, after getting an email for being accepted &#x1F648;</sub></center><br>\n<p>It was an adventurous experience applying for this internship, and it’s pretty cool seeing what is behind Firefox, and the feeling of having some patches landed.</p>\n<p>There will be three months ahead and am so excited about it.
