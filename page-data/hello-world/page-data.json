The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"May 01, 2015","description":null,"tags":["life","2019","zoos"],"disqus":null},"fields":{"langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/open-source-beginnings-mozilla/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"open-source-beginnings-mozilla"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 07, 2019","title":"My Open-Source Beginnings with Mozilla","tags":null}},"next":null,"previousInSameTag":{"fields":{"slug":"/disqus/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"disqus"},"frontmatter":{"date":"June 10, 2019","title":"Show Disqus","tags":["2019"]}},"nextInSameTag":null,"translationsLink":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["1522010811","1615650028","2894998521","3765107650","592141294"]}
